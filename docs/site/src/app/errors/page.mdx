# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Mistakes happen, and mostly they will be yours, not ours. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can tell if your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, you can use the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging.

{/*<Note>
  Before reaching out to support with an error, please be aware that 99% of all
  reported errors are, in fact, user errors. Therefore, please carefully check
  your code before contacting Protocol support.
</Note>*/}

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the Protocol API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means it's a _you_
    problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — you won't be seeing these.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Error types

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the Quti API will return an error response with an error message. You can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

		Beside the error message Quti returns the error-type in the reponse HTTP-Header slot `X-RSD-Error-Type`.
		Here is a list of the error types supported by the Quti API — use these to understand what you have done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="NotFound">
        This means the object you requested from the server was not found
      </Property>
      <Property name="InvalidContent">
        This means the content you passed in the request body was invalid (eg a required field was missing)
      </Property>
			<Property name="InvalidArgument">
				This means one of the query/path parameters passed was invalid
			</Property>
    </Properties>
